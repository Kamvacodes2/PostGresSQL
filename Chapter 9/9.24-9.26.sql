-- improving performance when updating large tables

--Table Size Inflation: 
-- Adding a column and filling it with values in PostgreSQL 
-- can inflate the tableâ€™s size due
-- to the creation of new row versions without deleting old ones.


--Impact: For small datasets, the size increase is negligible, 
-- but it can be substantial for large tables with many rows, 
-- increasing update time and disk usage.

--Alternative Approach: Instead of adding a column and updating it, 
-- you can save disk space by copying the entire table with the new populated column, 
--then renaming the tables to replace the original with the copy, 
-- keeping the original as a backup.
