--  focuses on techniques to create reusable PostgreSQL database objects
-- shortcuts to encapsulate queries and logic.


-- Using Views to Simplify Queries

-- A view is a virtual table created dynamically using a saved query

-- Functionality
-- Automatically runs the saved query each time it's accessed.
-- Can be queried, joined with tables or other views, and used for updates or inserts.


-- Difference from Tables
-- views donâ€™t store data
-- they execute their query each time they are accessed.

-- Benefits of Views:

-- Avoids duplicate query efforts.

-- Reduces complexity by showing only relevant columns.

-- Enhances security by restricting access to certain table columns.
